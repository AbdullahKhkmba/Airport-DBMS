The goal is to allow passengers to book tickets on flights. Each flight goes from Airport X to Airport Y using an aircraft model Z. Each airport has a name and a location. Each model has features like screens and Wi-Fi.
We need to:
-	List passengers on a particular flight.
-	List all minor passengers on a particular flight.
-	List passengers who traveled from airport X to airport Y on some time interval.
-	Count the number of empty seats on a flight.
-	List seat numbers of empty economy or first-class seats on a flight.
-	List all flights from airport X to airport Y ordered by price, number of stops or estimated time (journeys are included even if there is no direct flight from X to Y).
-	Listed flights might be filtered by the presence of Wi-Fi or any other feature.
-	Count the number of flights that used airport X for landing or departure in a given time interval or in general.
-	Count number of flights an aircraft did in a given time interval or in general.
