The database is a central airport database mangement system and its users are the personnel at the airport, the air travellers and their relatives. The system provides a broad overview of underlying operational factors that influence the airport management.

This database has or can be extended to have a lot of functionality like:

- Keeping track of flight status and schedules for the travellers to know about flight cancellation, flight delays
- Keeping a record of a passengerâ€™s journey from passenger processing.
- Retrieving information for different segments of users: passengers, or members of specific departments, authorities, business partners, or police.
